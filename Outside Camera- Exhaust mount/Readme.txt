Voron Trident Outside Camera

This mod takes the Annex K3 usermod "Ryan_G-K3_Outside_Camera" (https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Annex-Engineering_User_Mods/tree/main/Printers/K3/Ryan_G-K3_Outside_Camera) and retrofits it so that it is compatible with the Voron Trident.
It removes the exhaust filter and relocates the bowden tube to the side (instead of center).

I had a couple different cameras die, which i believe might be due to the chamber temps of the printer. So i asked around and our resident Annex/Voron friend Kmob had this mod on his printer and spoke highly of it. So it knew it was worth the time making it worked for trident!
