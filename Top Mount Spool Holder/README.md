# Voron Top Mounted Spool Holder

I wanted a top mounted spool holder on my Trident, and i really like Jeoje's Sturdy handles.
I took the Switchwire spoolholder and remixed it to fit on a 2020 extrusion, and then combined it with the base from the sturdy handles

## Parts Required
| Part | Quantity |
|------|------|
| M5 X 12 SHCS | 2 |
| M5 T-Nut | 2 |

## Printing

- Print using standard Voron part settings and in the orientation used in the STL
- Supports should not be needed, but the overhang is < 45 degrees.  That area is hidden from view and tolerances don't really matter there.

## Installation
- You will likely need to move the top panel out of the way for installation. Remove clips from one side and the middle to lift it up a bit.
